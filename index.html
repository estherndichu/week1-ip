        <h2>Projects</h2>   
        <p>I have created a few projects while in Moringa. They include;</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://estherndichu.github.io/Surfing-School-website/">surfing school website</a>.</li>
            <p>This is a project I created when I was in Moringa Pre-Prep. <span class="language">I used HTML and CSS.</span> It was a tricky project because it was my first time designing a website then proceed to code it. It took me a week and four days to finish this project.</p>
            <li><a href="https://estherndichu.github.io/resort/">hongwe resort project</a></li>
            <p>Hongwe resort required a website for their business, I used HTML and CSS to build them a good website. I created this project as an exercise during Prep coursework. It still needs a lot of work for it to be desirable to the customer.</p>
            <li><a href="https://estherndichu.github.io/news-article/">news article</a></li>
            <p>This is a news article that I created using dummy text. I used HTML and CSS. I added some pictures of news articles to populate the page.</p>

        <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
        <p>I was born in Lamu County in 1995. I am the second born of three kids. I started school in 1999. I completed my primary school education in 2008. I joined highschool in 2009 and went to a school in Limuru. The fees became too expensive and I had to transfer to another school in Tharaka-Nithi County. I completed my high school education in 2012. I got a B plain and was enrolled at Machakos University for a degree in Education(Home Economics).I joined university in 2013 and decided to change my course. My request to transfer to another course was accepted and I started my degree in Bachelor of Commerce. I graduated in 2018 with a Bachelor of Commerce (Accounting) second class lower division. My target was to get atleast a second class upper division so in my opinion I failed. </p>

        <h2>Work experience</h2>

        <p>I decided to apply for a job at KFC when I was in campus during a long holiday break. I got it and worked there for 6 months. After graduating I got a job at a cyber cafe and that is where my interest in computers started. I got pregnant and did not have a chance to pursue my interest. I started doing online writing while I took care of the baby. When I heard about Moringa School Access Program I was ecstatic and I took that opportunity to pursue my interest in coding</p>
